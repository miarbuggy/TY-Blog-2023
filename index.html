                            <p>The TY Programme at RedHat is an outreach program to let TY students have a taste of what a career in software
                                engineering can be like. The intake is 10 students and the programme lasts 5 days. During the programme, the TY
                                students are introduced to many things, such as mark-up languages, Git and GitHub, Python coding as well as the work ethics
                                and teamwork required to make the office work and the software tick.</p>
                            <p> Each TY must write a blog based on their experience and thoughts on their potential career in software programming.
                                Below we see the blog of Mia Buggy, one of the TYs in this year's programme.</p>

                                Mia Buggy is a 16 year old TY student who attends the Abbey Community College in Ferrybank. She
                                has always had an interest in computers and softwware development. She is a national-medal winning
                                gymnast at Waterford Gymnastics where she reguarly trains and now coaches. She can speak three and 
                                a half languages, English, Irish, French and Vietnamese and is a self taught guitarist and piano player.
                                She is a high achiever and enjoys reading, gaming, maths, coding, and learning languages. 
                                She also thinks too highly of herself and believes everyone loves her. Which is true.

                            <p>
                               Her goals for this week are to fiure out if she would actually like a career in the technology industry and 
                               also to get a bt out of her comfort zone. Her regular Costa drink is a regular mocha with a pump of vanilla syrup
                               and whipped cream, and her favourite videogame is Rainbow Six Seige but all her friends hate it and refuse to play with her.

                            <p> On day one, I was very nervous, but I gradually got more comfortable throughout the day. We got all set up, had an introductory
                                meeting and then had a break where we played a couple rounds of pool. I came so close to winning. I also had my cup overflow at the coffee machine,
                                which was so embarassing. Not doing that again. After our lunch/break, we had a Git and GitHub workshop where we were introduced to Git and GitHub, 
                                which are forms of version control. Then we had an introduction to HTML and CSS (which I have previous knowlege on, not to flex or anything.)
                                We now have to work on our blogs, which we update throughout the week.
                            </p>
                            <p>On day two (today), we had a talk abot agility. We had a Microbit Workshop coming up after lunch, I had soup if you must know and I still can't 
                              stop laughing about Darragh falling off his bicycle and even drew it on the whiteboard. I was literally laughing the whole way through the pool game. Then at the MicroBit workshop I made 
                              a game about Darragh falling off his bicycle. This was written ny me while eating a Nature Valley bar. P.S. What makes it worse about my cup overflowing yesterday
                              is that there is actually a mocha option on the machine.

                            <p> Today we built LEGO and had talks about a day in the life of a stoftware engineer and a day in the life of an Applied Computing student at SETU.
                            It was a pretty relaxing day and I enjoyed the team building exercise. I worked on my own website, SongWrite, which I am building at home. It's purpose
                            is to give it's user chords based on the key they want their song in and the mood they are feeling. I made a few mistakes while trying to push it to GitHub 
                            but I resolved it with help from one of the mentors. Tomorrow we have to say a fun fact about ourselves in front of a room of people and I have no idea 
                            what I am going to say. P.S. I am still laughing about DArragh falling off his bike.
